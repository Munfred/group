I'm Florian Sch√§fer, assistant professor in the [School of Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](https://gatech.edu/).

Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I received my PhD in applied and computational mathematics at [Caltech](http://www.caltech.edu/), working with [Houman Owhadi](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~owhadi/index.htm).
Before that, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mathematics at the [University of Bonn](https://www.mathematics.uni-bonn.de/).

My research interests lie at the interface of numerical computation, statistical inference, and competitive games. 
To learn more, have a look at these [high-level summaries](/projects/) or my [thesis defense](https://youtu.be/Ph1pAv92WBQ).

**I am currently hiring PhD students. If you have a strong background in computational mathematics and the above seems interesting (or you have a project in mind that I might find interesting), feel free to reach out!**
