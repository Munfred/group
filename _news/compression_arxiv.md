New version of [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05351) on the recovery of elliptic solvers from matrix-vector products now on the arXiv. With greatly extended experiments, plenty of new figures, and theoretical results on the recovery of the continuous Green's function. Joint work with [Houman](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~owhadi/index.htm).
