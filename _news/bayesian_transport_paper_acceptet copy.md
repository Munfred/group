New [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01294) with [Yifan](https://yifanc96.github.io/) (lead author) and [Houman](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~owhadi/) now on the arXiv.
We use [KL-minimizing Cholesky factorization](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/20M1336254) to accelerate [GP-based PDE solvers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999121005635?via%3Dihub), resulting in scalable GP-based solvers for general PDEs!
