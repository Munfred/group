I gave a talk (virtually) at the [seminar for mathematics in imaging, data, and optimization at RPI](https://sites.google.com/view/rpimidoseminars), thanks to [Yangyang](https://xu-yangyang.github.io) for inviting me! You can find the video of the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYyxniHvQBc).
