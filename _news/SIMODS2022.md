I will be at the [Siam Conference on the Mathematics of Data Science](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/mds22) in San Diego from Sep. 26-30. I'll give a talk on locality-exploiting operator learning on Friday 11:00-11:25, as part of the [minisymposium on "Fast and Scalable Bayesian Inference"](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=74852). 
[Stephen](https://stephen-huan.github.io/) will also be there, and present his work on experimental design approaches to sparse linear algebra on Wednesday 3:15-3:40 in the [minisymposium on "Kernel Methods for Computing and Learning"](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=74626).
