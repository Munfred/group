[Spencer Bryngelson](https://comp-physics.group/), [Ali Mani](https://manigroup.stanford.edu/), and myself organized a minisymposium on Statistical approaches to closure modeling in computational mechanics at [IACM MMLDE-CSET 2023](https://www.utep.edu/engineering/mmlde/). 
[Ruijia](https://ruijiacao.github.io/) presented [our work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14127) on information geometric regularization. Collaborator [Jessie Liu](https://manigroup.stanford.edu/people/jessie-liu) presented ongoing work on the targeted computation of nonlocal closures via adjoint macroscopic forcing.
