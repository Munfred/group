Joint [work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01294) with [Yifan Chen](https://yifanc96.github.io/) and [Houman Owhadi](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~owhadi/index.htm) accepted at Mathematics of Computation. 
We use [Cholesky by KL minimization](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/20M1336254) to implement the [GP approach to solving nonlinear PDEs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999121005635) at near-linear computational cost!
