Work with [Houman](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~owhadi/) on the [sparse recovery of elliptic solution operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05351) now accepted to [SISC](https://www.siam.org/publications/journals/siam-journal-on-scientific-computing-sisc). This work exponentially reduces the sample complexity of provably learning elliptic solution operators from input-output pairs.
