[Joint work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08565) with [Jeffrey](https://18jeffreyma.github.io/), [Alistair](https://aletcher.github.io/), [Yuanyuan](http://shiyuanyuan.site/), and [Anima](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/) now on the arxiv. 
We extend [competitive gradient descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12103) to arbitrary numbers of agents, prove its local convergence, and show that it learns significantly more performant policies when used for multi-agent reinforcement learning.
